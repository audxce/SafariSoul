This web application project is based off our zoo miniworld. This website allows for regular users to browse animals, buy tickets and see information 
about the zoo, etc. Employee users are granted specific priviledges based on their role, whereas Admin level users are
granted complete control over zoo database information. This project was programmed in Visual Studio using the ASP.NET .NET 7 frameworks.
