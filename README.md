# SafariSoul
This web application is based off our zoo miniworld. This website allows for regular users to browse animals, buy tickets and see information 
about the zoo, etc. Employee users are granted specific priviledges based on their role, whereas Admin level users are
granted complete control to manage the database information. This project was programmed in Visual Studio using the ASP.NET and .NET 7 frameworks. 
The razor pages we created can be located in the Pages folder which is inside the SafariSoul folder. The Models folder contains the schema entities as well as the
dbcontext file. The wwwroot folder contains the css, javascript, images, etc. that are referenced in our pages. 
The official website is safarisoulzoo.com
